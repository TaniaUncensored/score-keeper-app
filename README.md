# score-keeper-app

Helps you to keep track of your score when playing a game of ping pong (or any other game that has 2 players for that matter :P)

First set the score to first get to and so win the game. 
Then start manually adding the score of both players.
If the max score is reached it'll display a text saying who the winner is and reset the game.
We also added a dark mode to the card, cause everything just looks cooler when in darkmode...

Enjoy!
